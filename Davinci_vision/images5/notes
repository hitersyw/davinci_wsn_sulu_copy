automate color search...

set threshold for orange/not-orange;
  compute centroid
  
grow square until avg color decreases?  
  then go a bit larger?  
  
  largest square in circle-->square diag = circle diam, 
  grow to circle contained in square--> circle diam = square side
  
  so, as grow square, find max square size, then increase by factor sqrt(2) 
  
  nom color: red ~ 137;
             green ~ 62
             blue ~ 46
