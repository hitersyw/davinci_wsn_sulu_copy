Davinci calibration: 10/1/15 (per Der-Lin e-mail)

left projection_matrix:
  rows: 3
  cols: 4
  data: [962.935699,     0,     262.567562,     0, 
           0,       962.935699, 254.56654,      0, 
           0,            0,        1,           0]

right projection_matrix:
  rows: 3
  cols: 4
  data: [962.935699,      0,        262.567562,  5.452152, 
           0,           962.935699, 254.56654,     0, 
           0,             0,            1,         0]

should be: (intrinsic matrix of the rectified image, includes 3x3 camera matrix)
[fx'  0   cx'  Tx
 0    fy' cy'  Ty
 0    0    1    0]

interpret: 
left and right are both 640/480 pixels;
left and right are both 963 pixels focal length
  central pixel: left (262.6,254.6)  vs right(262.6, 254.6)  (why not 320/240??)

note: L/R foci and central pixels are IDENTICAL
Tx = -fx' * B, where B is the baseline between the cameras.
w/rt rectified images:
[u v w]' = P * [X Y Z 1]'
u,v are in pixels;
cx,cy is image center
fx, fy are focal lengths, expressed in pixels


from 10/1 davinci images, red ball is approx:
  red= 122
  green = 69 
  blue = 44
   r/(g+1+b+1) = 1.06

background is:
   red 173
   green 159
   blue  112
   r/(g+1+b+1) = 0.63

shadow is:
   red 108
   green 86
   blue 56
   r/(g+1+b+1) = 0.75

Davinci (physical) example projection matrix:
projection
2705.721674 0.000000 116.915465 17.786444
0.000000 2705.721674 283.495354 0.000000
0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000

this would imply:
  focal length, in pixels, = 2706
  central pixel = (117,283)  (expected 240,320)
  baseline = 17.786/2706 = 0.0066

ball diam of 10mm shows up as 60 pixels in diam...but don't really know dist
