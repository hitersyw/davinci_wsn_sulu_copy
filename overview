Davinci summary:

roslaunch dvrk_model wsn_davinci_gazebo.launch

rosrun davinci_traj_streamer davinci_traj_interpolator_as

rosrun rviz rviz

cd ros_ws/src/davinci_wsn/davinci_playfiles

PLAYFILE READER, JOINT SPACE (.jsp file, editable)
rosrun playfile_reader playfile_jointspace testfile2.jsp

joint-space playfiles have format: 
arm1, 7 jnts (last jnt is gripper opening angle);
arm2, 7 jnts
arrival time

rosrun playfile_reader playfile_cartspace retract.csp
from same dir, 
rosrun playfile_reader playfile_cartspace hand_off_peg.csp

THESE USE text "playfiles" in joint space. (csp for cartesian-space)
does IK to get joint-space goals, then interpolates in joint space;
file format: 
arm1: Ox,Oy,Oz, x_vec, z_vec, gripper opening
arm2: Ox,Oy,Oz, x_vec, z_vec, gripper opening
arrival time


Cartesian moves, w/rt left-camera optical frame:

rosrun cart_move_as cart_move_as  (in addition to joint-space server); 
  leave this server running

example client:
rosrun cart_move_as cart_move_client_example

see action message in: /cwru_msgs/cwru_action/action/cart_move.action
includes two gripper poses, two jaw angles, one arrival time;
better--extend this to vectors of the above

davinci_kinematics:
  fwd and inverse kinematics; publisher to joints, including mimic joints
  uses custom IK
  see davinci_kinematics.h and *.cpp for LOTS of comments
  used in cartesian moves
  
davinci_opencv: start on some image processing; still trying to get calibration

davinci_playfiles: text files, jsp and csp

davinci_traj_streamer:  includes action server to accept joint-space trajectories,
  interpolate them, and send streamed commands to (all) gazebo joints
  
  
Davinci_vision: contains red-ball snapshots; attempting calibration

dvrk_model:  wsn gazebo extension, plus stereo cameras

playfile_reader: parses jsp or csp files and sends commands to action servers

wsn_move_davinci_rviz: obsolete--no Gazebo
  
camera_calibration:  moves virtual checkerboard under cameras to get
  stereo camera calibration;  

(trying to get real camera calibration)
